# Business & Consumer Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail Superstore dataset
to understand customer purchasing behavior, sales trends, and profitability patterns.
The analysis focuses on deriving actionable business insights using data visualization
and statistical exploration.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
- Perform data inspection and cleaning
- Analyze sales distribution and profitability

- Missing value and duplicate analysis
- Sales distribution analysis
- Category-wise sales comparison
- Region-wise profit analysis
- Discount vs Profit relationship
- Monthly sales trend analysis

## Tools & Technologies
